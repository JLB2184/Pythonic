    Terms:
        Configuration Data: Parameters passed over the GUI by the user
        Input Data: Data which is forwarded from other elements

    General behaviour:
        When an element returns None, subsequent
        elements are still triggered

    Logging:

        #1 INFO:
            Ordinary debug trace messages
            Can be switched on or off by the user (checkbox in element configuration)
            Implementation in own code is optional
        

        #2 WARNING: 
            Signalize a failed execution
            Can be switched on or off by the user (checkbox in element configuration)
            A log entry of this type is created when the element returns data of type PythonicError
            Implementation in own code is optional

        #3 Critical (Unhandled exception):
            Is signalized in the GUI an (,,Exception occured, open log for details)
            Log entry (type ERROR) is made
            Is always active (implementation not optional)


    Error handling:

        #1
        Elements should throw an exception when configuration
        data is missing or cannot be processed

        #2
        Elements should try to handle all possible exceptions internally
        and only throw critical exceptions.

        #3
        The result of a operation (if successfull or not (see #2)) should always
        be forwarded to subsequent elements in order to react to a possible failed call.
        If the result of a failed call could be processed by an subsequent element,
        it should be wrapped inside the PythonicError type.

        #4
        In case of a failed call, a meaningful message or the exception text should returned
        (PythonicError as data parameter in returned Record type)

        #4
        Dont to use logging.error or logging.warning as it has no effect if used in combination with multiprocessing.
